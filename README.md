**Q1. Difference between REST and SOAP ?**

***SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)*** is an XML-based messaging protocol for exchanging information among computers. 
SOAP’s built-in WS-Security standard uses XML Encryption, XML Signature, and SAML tokens to deal with transactional messaging 
security considerations. SOAP also supports OASIS and W3C recommendations.

SOAP’s built-in standards and envelope-style of payload transport require more overhead compared to working with other 
API implementations, such as REST. However, organizations that require more comprehensive security and compliance may 
benefit from using SOAP.
